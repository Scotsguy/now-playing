        **This issue tracker is not intended for support requests!** Unless you are certain that 
        you have found a defect, and you are able to point to where the problem is, you should not 
        open an issue. For general support or if you're unsure, please 
        [ask on Discord](https://discord.gg/sSgQ9AF4mU).
        <br><br>
        Additionally, please make check the following:
        
        - **Have you used the [search tool](https://github.com/Scotsguy/now-playing/issues) to 
        check whether your issue has already been reported?** If it has been, consider adding more 
        information to the existing issue instead.
        
        - **Have you determined the minimum set of instructions to reproduce the issue?** If your 
        problem only occurs with other mods installed, then you should narrow down exactly which 
        mods are causing the issue. Please do not provide your entire list of mods and expect that 
        we will be able to figure out the problem.
